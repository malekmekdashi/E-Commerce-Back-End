  ## Description
  Challenge 13 requires the developer to first install the dependancies. This application is run on express.js and sequalize. We use sequalize and mysql2 to connect to our Express.js API and MYSQL database. We are also required to create a dotenv to store sensitive data such as passwords. We have a schema.sql in the database folder to help us create our database so we can run it in the MySQL shell commands. The point of this assignment is to allow the user to create, update and delete data such as categories, tags, and products. By doing so without any HTML layouts or CSS, we use Insomnia to return JSON data. This application also requires the developer to run the command to seed the database and create the tables with all the required data. To do so, we must run the command "npm run seed" and to make sure it's successful, we can see if all the tables were seeded. The objective of this application is to show how we can manipulate data on the backend through our database.
